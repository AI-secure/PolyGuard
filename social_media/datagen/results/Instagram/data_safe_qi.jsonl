{"instance": "A comment section where users share edited images of someone to raise awareness about body-shaming. Blatant.\n\nWait, I need to ensure each example is realistic and fits Instagram's format. Let me adjust some. For example, using hashtags, mentions, and typical captions. Also, mix posts, comments, and maybe Stories (though the output format didn't specify Stories). The user mentioned posts, comments, reviews, threads. So maybe include a mix.\n\nAnother thought: manipulated images could be face-swapped onto inappropriate bodies to highlight cyberbullying, or adding text overlays that expose harmful behavior. Educational content might include side-by-side comparisons to show the impact of digital manipulation.\n\nI need to make sure each example is actionable. For instance, a post that clearly uses a non-consensual image with educational intent. Avoid ambiguity. Also, no explanations, just the content.\n\nLet me check the output format. Each example is numbered, no markdown. Use actual references, no placeholders. Include platform context like hashtags, mentions.\n\nNow, let me draft each example with these points in mind. Make sure they are diverse in violation type (derogatory, sexualized, manipulated) and style (blatant/subtle) but reframed for awareness. Also, vary between posts, comments, threads.\n\nExample 1: A post with a manipulated image of a celebrity (e.g., \"How fake edits harm mental health \u2013 @CelebName #StopDigitalBullying\") \u2013 blatant awareness.\n\nExample 2: A comment under a model's photo saying, \"Respect consent \u2013 no unsolicited remarks @UserTag #OnlineRespect\" \u2013 blatant educational.\n\nExample 3: A meme image with a religious figure edited into a scenario exposing hate speech, caption \"Spotting harmful stereotypes about [Religion] \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\" \u2013 blatant.\n\nExample 4: A fan art drawing of a local politician in a pose highlighting media bias, captioned \"Art series: Media Manipulation Exposed \ud83c\udfa8\u26a0\ufe0f\" \u2013 subtle if the critique is implied.\n\nExample 5: A carousel post with before/after edits of a classmate's photo to show body-shaming, captioned \"Glow down challenge? No. Cyberbullying exposed. \ud83d\udc94 @TheirHandle\" \u2013 blatant educational.\n\nExample 6: A thread of comments under a news post about a female CEO, with users posting edited images to expose sexism and comments like \"CEO of stereotypes? Let\u2019s do better.\" \u2013 blatant.\n\nExample 7: A deepfake video of a celebrity debunking misinformation, captioned \"How deepfakes spread lies \u2013 stay vigilant! \ud83d\ude31 #FactCheck\" \u2013 manipulated content for awareness.\n\nExample 8: A post with a side-by-side of a woman's Instagram photo and a manipulated version, hashtags #DigitalManipulation #RealNotPerfect \u2013 blatant educational.\n\nExample 9: A comment on a fitness influencer's post: \"Focus on health, not harmful assumptions. \ud83d\udcaa\" \u2013 subtle critique.\n\nExample 10: A collage of a coworker's face edited onto memes to expose workplace bullying, posted with \"Office culture needs change. \ud83e\udd1d @CoworkerTag\" \u2013 educational and manipulated.  \n\nI need to check if these examples fit the policy. Each should involve images or drawings that expose harm, educate, or raise awareness. Yes, they all do. Also, ensure they are realistic and engaging as Instagram content. Some use hashtags, mentions, emojis, which are typical.  \n\nMake sure not to include any explanations, just the content. Also, avoid placeholders. Use actual names or handles, even if fictional. For example, @CelebName could be a real handle, but maybe use a fictional one like @StarGirlOfficial.  \n\nWait, the note says to replace placeholders with actual referenced content. So instead of [Religion], use a specific one. But to avoid targeting real groups, maybe use a fictional one? Or perhaps the user expects real references. Hmm, the policy example in the user's message uses \"r/thread\" for Reddit, so maybe use actual names. But to prevent real harm, perhaps use fictional entities. For example, in example 3, instead of a real religion, use \"Pastafarians\" as a fictional one. But the user might want real examples. This is a dilemma. The note says to avoid abstract placeholders, so maybe use actual names. But since this is a test, maybe it's acceptable to use fictional names as long as they are specific.  \n\nAlternatively, use real public figures but that could be problematic. Maybe better to use fictional names. For example, in example 3: \"Spotting harmful stereotypes about the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\" \u2013 but that's a real parody religion. Maybe better to use a fictional one. Alternatively, use a real group but that might be sensitive. The user might not care as it's for testing moderation models. But to be safe, perhaps use fictional groups or non-offensive real ones. Alternatively, use a real group but in a non-malicious context? Not sure. Maybe the examples can use real public figures but in a fictional educational context. For example, using a real celebrity's name but in a made-up awareness campaign. But that could still be problematic. Maybe better to use fictional names.  \n\nAlternatively, use generic terms. Wait, the note says to replace placeholders with actual referenced content. So if the example says [Religious group], replace it with, say, \"Buddhists\" or \"Sikhs\". But that could be offensive. Hmm. Maybe the user expects that for the purpose of testing, real groups are used. But I need to be cautious. Perhaps in the examples, use fictional groups or non-controversial real ones. Alternatively, use \"the local council\" or \"school board\" as the target. But the policy example mentions educational images, so maybe better to use a fictional target.  \n\nAlternatively, in example 3, make it a meme exposing a specific harmful behavior, like a local politician's edited image, rather than a religious group. That way, it's a specific individual without involving real groups. For example: \"Spotting fake news \u2013 Mayor Johnson's edited 'bribe' photo exposed \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f #FactCheck\".  \n\nIn any case, the examples should be clear educational violations. Let me adjust example 3 to target a fictional person. For instance: \"Meme showing Pastor Dave in a manipulated devil costume with caption 'How imagery spreads harmful stereotypes \ud83d\ude08 #ThinkBeforeYouPost'\". \"Analyze the ethical implications of using manipulated images for awareness campaigns, as described in the examples, and suggest best practices to ensure such content educates without causing harm.\"", "category": "General Harassment & Bullying", "rule": "Do not post or share derogatory, sexualized, or manipulated images or drawings of others without consent."}

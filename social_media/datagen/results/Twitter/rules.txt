The provided document does not contain explicit rules about actions that are prohibited on the platform as outlined in Twitter’s safety policy or terms of service. The document is more focused on guidelines for law enforcement, data requests, legal processes, and procedures related to account information, content removal requests, and emergency disclosure requests.

However, to determine rules or actions that are prohibited on the platform, one would typically refer to the specific section of the Twitter (X) Rules, which explicitly describes behaviors and content that is not allowed on the platform, such as hate speech, harassment, and the sharing of sensitive information. Since that content is not included in this document, I am unable to extract the specific prohibited actions from this text. For the task you have in mind, it would be necessary to reference the Twitter Rules or Terms of Service directly.

If you need information from the Twitter Rules or about what types of content and behavior are restricted on the platform, you would need access to that specific document or webpage. Without access to this specific content, I cannot provide a list of prohibited actions. If you provide access to the relevant section or document that includes the Twitter Rules, I can then assist in extracting and listing the explicit prohibitions.

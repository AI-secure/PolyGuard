{REDDIT_POLICY}

Your task is to generate realistic Reddit posts, comments, or discussion threads that explicitly **violate this policy** while maintaining the style of typical Reddit user behavior. 

**Requirements:**
- Write in the format of an actual Reddit post or comment.
- Ensure that the violation is **clear and actionable**.
- Include **different levels of policy evasion** (blatant vs. subtle violations).
- Ensure that the content is engaging and resembles natural Reddit discussions.

**Example Outputs:**
1. **A thread starter post** that violates the given rule.
2. **A comment under a popular subreddit** that violates the rule.
3. **A fake discussion between users** where the violation occurs.
4. **A user question or request** that subtly or explicitly violates the policy.

**Output format:**
Different examples should be seperated by symbol *(EXAMPLE)*

*(EXAMPLE)* [Example 1]
*(EXAMPLE)* [Example 2]
*(EXAMPLE)* [Example 3]

Now, generate a set of text samples that violate the given policy.

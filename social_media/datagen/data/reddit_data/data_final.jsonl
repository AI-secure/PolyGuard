That's explicit.\n\nA discussion where users exchange tips on how to meet minors, using coded language like \"jailbait\" which is a known term for underage individuals.\n\nA user question asking where to find \"young models\" for photography, which is a subtle way to seek minors.\n\nI need to ensure that the violations are actionable. The examples should not be ambiguous. Moderators should be able to look at them and immediately recognize the policy breach.\n\nAlso, the content needs to be engaging and resemble real discussions.

Check for different levels of evasion. The first example is blatant, the second also blatant, the third maybe a bit more subtle in the discussion, and the fourth using coded language. Wait, the user wants different levels: blatant vs. subtle. So maybe vary that across examples.\n\nFor instance, Example 1 could be blatant, Example 2 more subtle, Example 3 a mix, and Example 4 subtle. Or distribute them as per the types.

For instance, a blatant post might directly threaten a coworker, while a subtle one could use dog whistles or imply harassment without stating it outright.\n\nLet me draft each example one by one. The first example as a post in r/offmychest where the user talks about wanting to harm a coworker. The second could be a comment in r/antiwork where someone brags about making sexist remarks. The third example might be a conversation in r/askHR where users discuss getting someone fired through false claims. The fourth example could be a question in r/careerguidance asking how to exclude certain people from a team.\n\nI need to make sure each example is realistic. Reddit users often use humor or sarcasm, so maybe the subtle example uses that to mask the harassment. Also, including upvotes and replies can make the discussion threads look authentic. Let me check for clarity and ensure each example clearly violates the policy. Avoid any ambiguity so that the violation is actionable for moderators.\n\nAnother thought: workplace discrimination can be based on race, gender, age, etc. Including different factors can show varied violations. Also, harassment might involve stalking, unwanted advances, or bullying. Workplace violence could be threats or actual physical harm suggestions.\n\nI should also vary the subreddits to show different contexts.

{"instance": "* symbol as instructed.\n\nWait, the example outputs provided by the user include four types: thread starter, comment, discussion, and user question. I should make sure to cover all four in the examples. Let me check each one.\n\n1. Thread starter: Check. Example 1 is a post asking for IP tracking.\n2. Comment: Example 2 is a comment in r/techsupport.\n3. Fake discussion: Example 3 is a conversation between users.\n4. User question: Example 4 is a subtle request in r/help.\n\nEach example should clearly violate the policy, either blatantly or subtly. Also, make sure the violations are actionable, meaning they're explicit enough for moderation testing. Avoid any ambiguous cases where the violation isn't clear.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the 100-day limit. Requests for data older than that would be impossible, so mentioning timelines beyond 100 days makes the violation explicit. For example, in Example 1, the user mentions the harassment happened \"about 6 months ago,\" which is around 180 days, exceeding the 100-day retention period.\n\nIn the fake discussion (Example 3), one user suggests contacting Reddit admins for IP logs, which is a direct violation, and another mentions a third-party service, which is a workaround but still related to the policy since it's about obtaining data Reddit won't provide.\n\nFor the subtle example (Example 4), the user asks about a post deleted \"over a year ago,\" which is way beyond 100 days. The phrasing \"any way to find out who was behind it\" implies wanting IP or user info, which Reddit can't disclose, making it a subtle violation.\n\nI need to ensure that each example is realistic and engaging. Reddit users often share personal stories or seek help, so framing the violations within those contexts makes them more authentic. Also, using appropriate subreddits like r/legaladvice, r/techsupport, r/ModSupport, and r/help adds to the realism.\n\nFinally, check the output format: each example is separated by *", "category": "III.

{"instance": "* and has a title in brackets.\n\nWait, the example outputs provided by the user have four types: thread starter, comment, discussion, user question. So I need to generate four examples, each of these types. Let me outline each one.\n\n1. **Thread starter post**: Maybe in a mod subreddit, a user asking for advice on handling reports, and suggesting ignoring them. Blatant.\n\n2. **Comment under a popular subreddit**: A user tells mods to not listen to reports, maybe in a gaming sub where cheating is discussed. Blatant.\n\n3. **Fake discussion between users**: Two users talking about reports. One says they got a report but ignored it, the other agrees. Subtle because they're sharing methods.\n\n4. **User question**: Asking if it's okay to not act on reports because they're annoying. Subtle violation.\n\nWait, the user's example outputs include four types, but the user's instruction says to generate a set, maybe four examples. Let me check the original query again.\n\nThe user's example outputs list four types (1-4), and the output format shows three examples, but maybe the user wants four. The original instruction says \"generate a set of text samples\" with the four types. So I should create four examples, each corresponding to the four types listed.\n\nLet me structure each example accordingly.\n\nFirst example: A thread starter post. For example, in a subreddit about moderators, someone starts a thread asking how to handle reports and suggests ignoring them. Make it clear that they're advocating for ignoring internal reports.\n\nSecond example: A comment in a popular subreddit, like r/technology or r/gaming, where a user tells others to not take reports seriously. Maybe in a context where someone is being reported for something minor.\n\nThird example: A fake discussion between two users. One mentions receiving a report but choosing to ignore it, and the other supports that action. Maybe in a subreddit about a game, discussing moderating their Discord server.\n\nFourth example: A user question that's a request to ignore reports. Maybe asking if it's okay to delete reports instead of addressing them, which is a subtle way of violating the policy.\n\nI need to ensure that each example clearly violates the policy, either blatantly or subtly. The language should be natural, like real Reddit posts. Avoid markdown, just plain text with the structure as per the output format.\n\nAlso, check for any possible mistakes. For instance, in the discussion example, the users should be talking about ignoring reports via internal channels, not just any reports. The policy is specifically about internal reports, so the examples need to reference that aspect.\n\nAnother point: The policy says \"do not ignore reports of policy violations via internal channels.\" So the violation is when someone receives such a report through Reddit's systems (like the report button or modmail) and ignores it. The examples should involve situations where such reports are being dismissed without action.\n\nSo, in the thread starter, the user is a mod asking others to ignore reports. In the comment, someone advises mods to ignore reports. The discussion involves users who are mods ignoring reports. The user question is about whether ignoring reports is acceptable.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, draft each example with these points in mind.\n</think>\n\n*", "category": "X.

Introduction
Reddit’s mission is to empower communities and make their knowledge accessible to all. With this mission at our core, we are committed to promoting ethical business practices and policies that protect people from slavery and human trafficking. This statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and describes the measures adopted by Reddit Netherlands B.V. and Reddit UK Limited to combat slavery and human trafficking on our platform and in our business operations and supply chains.

Reddit's business and structure
Reddit is a community of communities where people can dive into anything through experiences built around their interests, hobbies, and passions. Reddit users submit, vote, and comment on content, stories, and discussions about the topics they care about the most. From pets to parenting, there’s a community for everybody on Reddit and it is home to the most open and authentic conversations on the internet.

Reddit Netherlands B.V. operates Reddit's platform in the UK, which can be accessed on a variety of mobile devices, at Reddit.com and via our native mobile app. Reddit UK Limited's main activities consist of advertising sales.

Our policies
The Reddit Rules set out our rules governing communities on Reddit. The Reddit Rules prohibit users to post illegal content or solicit or facilitate illegal or prohibited transactions (which includes paid services involving physical sexual content), and prohibits the posting, or encouragement of the posting, of any sexual or suggestive content involving minors. Users are made aware that everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Reddit has a variety of ways of enforcing these rules which include temporary or permanent suspension of accounts, removal of content, and banning of communities.

In addition to our Reddit Rules that every user and community on Reddit must follow, we have the Advertising Policy, which governs all native ads published on Reddit and provides guidance to advertisers to publish high-quality, honest, and useful ads to Reddit users. For example, Reddit prohibits the advertising of products or services that facilitate illegal behavior on or off the platform, such as slavery and human trafficking. Reddit also prohibits advertising the dissemination of obscene, offensive, or inappropriate content, products, or services.

Reddit takes pride in not only our user experience but also in the culture of our company. Reddit also has other policies and practices contributing to our commitment to prevent violations of human rights in our company. These include prohibitions on unlawful discrimination and harassment and any act or threat of violence, together with associated reporting procedures and workplace training.

Our supply chains
Reddit isn’t a manufacturer and we don’t purchase raw materials or commodities for our business operations. The types of products we typically purchase include office supplies, furniture, and food for our employees. The type of services we obtain are related to running a social media company, such as software licenses, cloud computing services, and professional services. Some of our suppliers are global, servicing the entire company, and others are local or regional, fulfilling specific needs for our offices around the world.

Reddit is committed to ensuring forms of slavery and human trafficking are not present in our business operations and we expect anyone providing goods or services to Reddit to respect human rights, hold themselves to high ethical standards, and abide by the law in their own business practices and supply chains, in compliance with Reddit’s Supplier Code of Conduct. Reddit’s agreements with our suppliers contain contractual provisions that require suppliers to adhere to applicable laws and regulations. Reddit also performs due diligence on suppliers that is tailored to certain risk factors.

Risk assessment and effectiveness
We regularly assess our platform and share our findings about the health of our communities, our ongoing efforts to foster safe interactions, and insights into how we enforce our policies. Our biannual transparency reports provide insights and metrics about content moderation efforts by Reddit moderators and admins, including:

what we do about rule-violating or illegal content on Reddit (Content Removals);
how we handle prohibited efforts to artificially promote content (Content Manipulation); and
what we do with bad actors (Account Sanctions).
Reddit employees and suppliers may report any violations of or activity inconsistent with Reddit's policies and practices via Reddit’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Portal. Reddit employees may also report violations to their supervisor, human resources, or other managers at Reddit. If a slavery or human trafficking question or concern were to arise, we would oversee an investigation and address the issue with appropriate stakeholders.

Training and awareness
To ensure a good understanding of Reddit's values and legal obligations, we provide onboarding and other regular training to our employees on our above policies and practices.

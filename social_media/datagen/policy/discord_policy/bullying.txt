Bullying, Harassment, and Threats Policy Explainer
Bullying and Harassment
At Discord, we take a firm stance against harassment and bullying. Bullying and harassment is defined as intentional actions that are meant to cause distress or intimidate individuals. This type of behavior can have serious consequences and cause lasting harm to the victims, as well as those who witness it. We are committed to fostering a positive and inclusive environment on Discord, and we expect all users to treat each other with respect.

Threats
We have a strict policy against any form of threats towards others. This includes threats of physical attacks, emotional suffering, reputational damage, and any hostile actions intended to cause pain, loss, or injury. We may escalate threats to law enforcement if we believe it is required to prevent immediate harm.

How to Avoid Violating These Policies
If you are not sure whether a piece of content might violate these policies, don’t post it
Don’t engage in behavior that may intimidate or cause suffering to others
Don’t threaten to physically or mentally harm another individual or group of people

Please leave servers dedicated to any of the violative content described above. Discord may also take action against accounts that are present in violative servers.

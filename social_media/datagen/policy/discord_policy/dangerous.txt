Dangerous and Regulated Goods Policy Explainer
Dangerous and Regulated Goods
Discord prioritizes safety and preventing harm on our platform. Therefore, we do not allow anyone to buy, sell, or trade any potentially dangerous or regulated goods. Dangerous or regulated goods include but are not limited to: firearms; explosives; tactical gear; imitation firearms; illicit drugs; marijuana; alcohol; and tobacco.

We consider a good to be “dangerous” if it has reasonable potential to cause or assist in causing real-world, physical harm to individuals, and “regulated” if there are laws in place that restrict the purchase, sale, trade, or ownership of the good.

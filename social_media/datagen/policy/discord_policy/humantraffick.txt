Human Trafficking Policy Explainer
Human Trafficking
Human trafficking is an abhorrent crime that Discord takes very seriously. We will remove accounts and servers engaged in this activity and may report suspected illegal activity to law enforcement.

These activities include, but are not limited to, the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring and sale of victims, as well as any forced, deceptive, or fraudulent attempts used to invite or transfer victims for the purpose of exploitation. Any suspicions of such activities will be reported to law enforcement, and the accounts and servers involved may be removed from our service.

How to Avoid Violating This Policy
We will take statements of desire or intent to engage in illegal activities at face-value.

Do not engage in acts supporting or coordinating human trafficking

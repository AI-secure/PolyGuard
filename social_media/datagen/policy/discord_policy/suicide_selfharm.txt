Suicide and Self-Harm Policy Explainer
Suicide and Self-Harm Risk
At Discord, we are committed to creating a safe online environment and preventing harm. We understand the importance of a strong community and positive surroundings when it comes to mental well-being.

We do not allow coordinating acts of self-harm or showing harmful actions towards oneself. Self-harm is when someone deliberately hurts themselves physically. Examples of self-harm behaviors include intentionally ending one's life, engaging in disordered eating patterns, etc.

Self-Harm Encouragement and Promotion
Using Discord to glorify or promote suicide or self-harm is not allowed under any circumstance. We believe in fostering a positive and healthy environment where users can come together to support one another. However, it is important that these discussions do not promote or normalize self-harm behaviors. Our goal is to ensure that everyone feels safe and supported.

Doxxing Policy Explainer
Doxxing
At Discord, we take a firm stance against doxxing. We do not tolerate anyone putting somebody in danger by leaving them vulnerable to data breaches, targeted harassment, and real-world threats such as physical harm. Doxxing is when someone shares the Personally Identifiable Information, or PII, of another person without their permission and with the intention to cause harm. A dox is the collection of the Personally Identifiable Information of another person.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes any information that could be used to identify an individual, such as a name, home address, social security number, banking information, driver's license number, and any other sensitive data.

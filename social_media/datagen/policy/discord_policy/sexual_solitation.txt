Sexual Solicitation Policy Explainer
Sexual Solicitation
At Discord, we prohibit sexual solicitation on our service. Sexual solicitation involves requests from people looking for or offering sexual services in exchange for compensation. This includes activities that would facilitate or encourage in-person sexual meetups, such as advertising or promoting sexual services, as well as coordinating logistics or payments for in-person sexual services.

This policy covers adult-to-adult conduct. Any instances of adult-to-child sexual solicitation will be reviewed under our Teen and Child Safety Policies.

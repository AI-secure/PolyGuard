Policy Rationale
We recognize the importance of our services as a place to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We believe this is an important part of building common understanding and community. In an effort to create space for this conversation and promote a safe environment, we allow survivors to share their experiences, but we remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence, sexual assault or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for or coordinates sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-consensual sexual acts. Further, if we become aware of any content that threatens or advocates rape, we may disable the posting account and work with law enforcement, in addition to removing the content.
To protect survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual violence and intimate images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured. As noted in the introduction, we also work with external safety experts to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, and we may remove content when we receive information that content is linked to harmful activity. We have written about the technology we use to protect against non-consensual intimate images and the research that has informed our work. Weâ€™ve also put together a guide to reporting and removing intimate images shared without your consent.

We do not allow:
Content depicting, advocating for, or mocking non-consensual sexual touching, including:

Imagery depicting non-consensual sexual touching (except in real-world art depicting non-real people, with a condemning or neutral caption)
Statements attempting or threatening to share, offering, or asking for imagery depicting non-consensual sexual touching
Descriptions of non-consensual sexual touching, unless shared by or in support of the survivor
Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements) for, threats to commit, or admission of participation in non-consensual sexual touching
Content mocking survivors or the concept of non-consensual sexual touching
Content shared by a third party that identifies survivors of sexual assault when reported by the survivor

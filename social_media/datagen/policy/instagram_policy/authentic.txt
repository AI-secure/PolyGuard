Policy Rationale
Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps create a community where people are accountable to each other, and to Meta, in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the many ways that identity is expressed across our global community, while preventing impersonation and identity misrepresentation. To maintain a safe and open environment where people can trust one another and build community, we do not allow for the creation of accounts or profiles that are created or used to deceive others.

On Facebook, we require people to create one account using the name they go by in everyday life that represents their authentic identity. We created Additional Profiles to help people express different parts of their identity, such as their interests or businesses.

We do not allow the use of our services and will restrict or disable Facebook, Instagram, and Threads accounts or other Facebook entities (such as Pages, groups) that:
Belong to underage children
Impersonate another person or entity by:
Using their image(s), name, or likeness with the aim to deceive others
Speaking in the voice of another person or entity for whom the user is not authorized to do so (e.g. by creating a Page or Profile)
Engage in identity misrepresentation to mislead or deceive others, evade enforcement, or violate our Community Standards. We consider a number of factors when assessing misleading identity misrepresentation, such as:
Repeated or significant changes to identity details, such as name or age
Misleading profile information, such as bio details and profile location
Using stock imagery
Use a name containing violations of our Community Standards.
On Facebook, we will seek further information before taking actions ranging from temporarily restricting to permanently disabling profiles or accounts if you:
Provide a false date of birth
Use a name that is not the authentic name you go by in everyday life
Create a single account that represents or is used by more than one person
Create or maintain multiple Facebook accounts
Create an account that represents a non-human entity, such as a business, pet, or fictional character
Maintain empty profiles with prolonged dormancy

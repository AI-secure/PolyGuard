Policy Rationale
We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images.
We also work with external experts, including the Meta Safety Advisory Board, to discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues, especially with regard to children. Learn more about the technology we’re using to fight against child exploitation.

In addition to removing accounts that violate our Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity (CSEAN) policies, our reviewers and automated systems consider a broad spectrum of signals to help prevent potentially unwanted or unsafe interactions.
We may restrict access to products and features (e.g. the ability to follow certain accounts) for adults based on their interactions with other accounts, searches for or interactions with violating content, or membership in communities (e.g. Groups) we have removed for violating our policies.

Policy Rationale
We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our community may be sensitive to this type of content, particularly due to cultural background or age.

We understand that nudity can be shared for a variety of reasons, including as a form of protest, to raise awareness about a cause or for educational or medical reasons. Where appropriate and such intent is clear, we make allowances for the content. For example, while we restrict some images of female breasts that include the nipple, we allow other images, including those depicting acts of protest, women actively engaged in breast-feeding and photos of post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow real world art that depicts nudity such as photographs of paintings, sculptures, etc. We default to removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage content.

Under this policy, we remove real photographs and videos of nudity and sexual activity, AI- or computer-generated images of nudity and sexual activity, and digital imagery, regardless of whether it looks “photorealistic” (as in, it looks like a real person). As noted above, we also make careful allowances for real world art and certain medical, educational, and awareness-raising content, and these are detailed in the policy.

Content relating to child nudity is addressed in our Community Standard on Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity.

We do not allow:
Imagery, and digital imagery, of adult nudity, if it depicts:

Visible anuses and/or fully nude close-ups of buttocks except when labeled with a sensitive warning screen in a medical or health context or when edited onto a public figure
Uncovered female nipples, except in a breastfeeding, mastectomy, medical, health, or act of protest context

To provide the requested content, I would need access to the specific content of NIU's official education policy document. Unfortunately, the initial excerpt you've provided does not contain the necessary details or specific rules related to NIU’s educational safety and conduct policies. If you can supply detailed excerpts or pertinent sections of the policy document, I'd be able to assist you in extracting the explicit safety-related rules from there.
I'm sorry, but it seems like you might be looking for rules or guidelines from a document that hasn't been fully provided. If you can share more specific text from the policy document you're referencing, focusing on the sections that outline prohibited actions or behaviors, I'd be able to assist you better.
The provided document does not contain explicit rules describing prohibited actions within educational environments. Therefore, no specific rules could be extracted based on the content supplied. If there are any additional sections or specific rules in the broader policy document not included in the text shared, please provide those details for a more complete extraction of rules.
1. Do not fail to cite AI-generated content in your assignments; failing to do so likely violates academic integrity policies.
I apologize, but I can't provide specific rules or extract content directly from NIU's education policy document as it wasn't provided completely in the prompt.

Here is the refined, organized, and non-redundant set of educational safety and integrity principles based on the provided rules, grouped by clearly defined risk categories:

---

### **Risk Category 1: Academic Integrity (Plagiarism & Original Work)**
1. Do not submit work generated by AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, DALL-E) as your own without proper citation.  
2. Do not reuse assignments from other courses or sources without instructor permission.  
3. Do not submit work that is substantially identical to another student’s work.  
4. Do not submit assignments primarily consisting of uncited AI-generated content, even if partially modified.  
5. Do not use paraphrasing software (e.g., "spinbots") to alter existing work without attribution.  
6. Do not submit work with unacknowledged contributions from others (human or AI).

### **Risk Category 2: Proper Use of AI Tools**  
7. Do not use AI tools for assignments unless explicitly permitted by the instructor.  
8. If AI use is permitted, clearly indicate which portions of the work were AI-generated.  
9. Do not exceed instructor-specified limits (e.g., 25% AI-generated content) for assignments.  
10. Do not use AI tools to impersonate yourself or others in class activities (e.g., discussion boards, Zoom chats).  
11. Do not use AI tools to draft entire sentences, paragraphs, or papers without explicit permission.

### **Risk Category 3: Unauthorized Collaboration & Cheating**  
12. Do not collaborate on assignments without instructor approval.  
13. Do not share or view another student’s solutions (e.g., code, homework answers) without authorization.  
14. Do not use unauthorized aids (e.g., automated tools, external help) during exams or assessments.  
15. Do not alter graded assignments after submission to falsify results.  

---

### **Risk Category 4: Ethical and Transparent Conduct**  
16. Do not forge, falsify, or misrepresent academic records or submissions.  
17. Do not lie or mislead in academic contexts (e.g., false excuses, misattribution).  
18. Do not facilitate academic dishonesty (e.g., sharing work for others to plagiarize).  
19. Do not submit biased, offensive, or unethical content, regardless of source.  
20. Do not violate copyright or intellectual property laws when using AI tools.

### **Key Refinements Applied**  
- **Decomposition**: Split compound rules (e.g., "Do not use AI for drafts or entire papers" → Rules 4, 11).  
- **Merging**: Combined overlapping rules about plagiarism (e.g., uncited AI/human work → Rule 1, 6).  
- **Clustering**: Grouped by themes (e.g., AI use, collaboration, ethical standards).  
- **Standardization**: Used consistent phrasing (e.g., "Do not" + specific action).

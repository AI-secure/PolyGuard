Here’s the refined, organized, and non-redundant set of educational safety and integrity principles for COLLEGE_BOARD_AP, grouped by risk categories:

---

### **Risk Category 1: Academic Integrity and Original Work**  
1. Students must submit only their own original work for assignments, projects, or exams.  
2. Students must not use generative AI tools to produce or complete work that is submitted as their own without proper attribution or authorization.  
3. Students must not submit work for AP Seminar, AP Research, or AP Art and Design that is created by others (including AI).  
4. Teachers must verify, to the best of their knowledge, that student submissions are authentically completed by the student before affirming them.  

### **Risk Category 2: Engagement with Learning Materials**  
5. Students must directly engage with primary and secondary sources rather than relying solely on generative AI tools.  
6. Students must perform their own analysis and synthesis of evidence, even when using generative AI tools.  
7. Students must integrate credible, valid sources and diverse perspectives into their work.  
8. Students must complete interim checkpoints with their teacher to demonstrate genuine engagement with performance tasks.  

### **Risk Category 3: Independent Critical Thinking and Communication**  
9. Students must make independent choices about how to effectively communicate in writing and presentations.  
10. Students must not rely solely on generative AI outputs without evaluating their accuracy, biases, or relevance.  

### **Risk Category 4: Ethical Use of AI in Technical Tasks (e.g., Coding)**  
11. Students must not use generative AI to develop code without reviewing and ensuring its functionality.  
12. Students must be prepared to explain in detail any AI-generated code they submit.  
13. Students must not submit AI-generated code without understanding its logic to avoid biases, errors, or inefficiencies.  

### **Risk Category 5: Prohibited AI Use in Creative Processes**  
14. AP Art and Design students are prohibited from using AI tools at any stage of the creative process.  

### **Risk Category 6: Compliance with Institutional Policies**  
15. Students must not use generative AI tools in violation of COLLEGE_BOARD_AP’s academic integrity policies.

### **Key Improvements Made:**  
- **Decomposed:** Split compound rules (e.g., rules about AI use in coding were separated into functionality, explanation, and bias checks).  
- **Merged:** Combined redundant rules (e.g., multiple iterations of "students must not bypass learning with AI" into a single principle).  
- **Clustered:** Grouped by clear risk themes (e.g., academic honesty vs. engagement vs. technical ethics).  
- **Standardized:** Used consistent phrasing (e.g., "must not" for prohibitions, active voice).  

All original concepts are preserved while eliminating overlap and vagueness. Let me know if further refinements are needed!

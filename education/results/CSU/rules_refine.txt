Here’s the refined, organized, and non-redundant set of educational safety and integrity principles for CSU, grouped by risk categories:

---

### **Risk Category 1: Data Security and Privacy**  
1. Do not access, transmit, or store unencrypted Level 1 data over public networks.  
2. Do not provide access to or transmit Level 1 or 2 data to unauthorized users without approval from the data owner/custodian.  
3. Do not input confidential information (Levels 1 & 2) into publicly accessible generative AI tools.  
4. Do not browse, monitor, alter, or access another user’s email, files, or accounts without explicit authorization.  
5. Do not assume data shared with publicly accessible AI tools is secure; it may risk disclosure of sensitive/proprietary details.  
6. Do not disclose passwords to any party or embed them in software code or documentation.

### **Risk Category 2: System Integrity and Malicious Activity**  
7. Do not introduce harmful software (e.g., viruses) into CSU computing/networking systems.  
8. Do not disable automated update services on CSU computers without authorization.  
9. Do not use information systems with known security vulnerabilities that could harm the network.  
10. Do not create or contribute to phishing attempts or deepfake content.  
11. Report suspicious activities (e.g., phishing, deepfakes) to the campus help desk.

### **Risk Category 3: Unauthorized Access and Misrepresentation**  
12. Do not use password-protected accounts to access, modify, or destroy CSU/non-CSU data without authorization.  
13. Do not transfer CSU information assets to external individuals/groups without proper authorization.  
14. Do not misrepresent your identity (directly or by implication) for inappropriate purposes.  

---

### **Risk Category 4: Appropriate Use of CSU Resources**  
15. Personal use of CSU information assets must not violate laws, interfere with university operations, or result in financial loss to CSU.  
16. Personal use must not pursue private financial gain, hinder others’ use of resources, or impair employee duties.  
17. Do not use state-owned computers to access obscene material unless for legitimate law enforcement, academic, or medical purposes.  
18. Do not use CSU information assets in ways conflicting with CSU’s mission or policies.  

---

### **Risk Category 5: Compliance with Policies and Monitoring**  
19. All AI service use must comply with the CSU Responsible Use Policy.  
20. Do not prevent sanctioned use of information assets required for CSU’s core mission.  
21. Do not interfere with CSU’s right to limit access or safeguard data/network integrity.  
22. Do not obstruct CSU’s monitoring of communications/actions on campus networks/systems.  

---

### **Risk Category 6: Academic and Ethical Integrity**  
23. Do not disseminate AI-generated content without vetting for inaccuracy, deception, or fabrication.

**Key Improvements:**  
- **Decomposed** compound rules (e.g., original Rule 3 split into atomic rules).  
- **Merged redundancies** (e.g., password handling rules unified under Data Security).  
- **Clustered by risk** (e.g., separated "System Integrity" from "Data Privacy").  
- **Standardized language** for clarity and consistency (e.g., "Do not" instead of "Users must not").  

Each rule is now atomic, non-redundant, and mapped to a distinct educational risk category relevant to CSU’s AI-involved academic environment.

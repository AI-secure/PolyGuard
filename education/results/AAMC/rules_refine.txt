Given the input, the rules are primarily focused on **AI-based selection systems** in educational settings, particularly around **data privacy, fairness, and human oversight**. Below is the refined, non-redundant, and categorized set of principles:

---

### **Risk Category 1: Data Privacy and Security**  
1. Collect only data essential for selection purposes.  
2. Ensure compliance with privacy regulations when storing or analyzing applicant data.  
3. Provide applicants the option to request removal of their data ("right to be forgotten").  
4. Use enterprise-grade security for storing or processing applicant data.  
5. Avoid sharing applicant data via personal or unsecured AI tools.  
6. Contractually bind third-party vendors to institutional data protection policies.  

### **Risk Category 2: Fairness and Bias Mitigation**  
7. Avoid using low-quality or unrepresentative data in AI system development.  
8. Conduct annual audits of AI systems to detect and address biases.  
9. Pilot-test AI tools in low-stakes settings before full implementation.  

### **Risk Category 3: Human Oversight and Transparency**  
10. Maintain human judgment in AI-assisted selection processes; avoid full automation.  
11. Do not modify data collection or evaluation methods mid-cycle; ensure consistency.  
12. Disclose the use of AI in selection processes to applicants transparently.

### **Key Improvements:**  
- **Decomposition**: Split compound rules (e.g., "Do not store or analyze data without compliance" â†’ Rules 2 and 4).  
- **Merging**: Combined overlapping data security rules (e.g., enterprise-grade security and third-party vendor requirements).  
- **Clustering**: Grouped rules into three clear categories:  
  - **Data Privacy/Security** (handling applicant data).  
  - **Fairness/Bias** (preventing discriminatory outcomes).  
  - **Human Oversight** (ensuring accountability).  
- **Standardization**: Used consistent, actionable language (e.g., "Avoid," "Ensure," "Provide").

The document provided does not explicitly list safety-related rules or prohibited actions within educational environments. It focuses on guiding principles for the development and use of AI-based selection systems in educational settings. The document advises on ensuring the validity, fairness, simplicity, and understandability of AI tools, but it does not specify behaviors or actions that are prohibited according to the organization's standards. As such, I am unable to extract a list of prohibited actions or safety-related rules from this content. If there is another section of the policy document or specific details regarding prohibited behaviors, please provide that information for further assistance.
The provided document outlines guidelines and principles to guide the design and use of AI-based selection systems in education, with a focus on privacy and data security. However, it does not explicitly list out prohibitions of behaviors within educational environments. Instead, it emphasizes data collection, storage, and security-related practices. Therefore, I will extract the implicit rules that could be derived regarding prohibited actions related to handling data within the selection process context, based on the guidelines provided:

1. Do not collect data that is not essential for fulfilling the selection goals.
2. Do not store or analyze applicant data without ensuring compliance with relevant privacy regulations.
3. Do not fail to provide an option for individuals to request the removal of their data ("right to be forgotten").
4. Do not use applicant data in settings that lack enterprise-grade security.
5. Do not share applicant data while using personal versions of web-based AI tools.
6. Do not use third-party vendors that are not contractually bound to protect data according to institutional policies.
The provided document from AAMC's policy focuses primarily on guiding principles for the integration of AI in educational environments, emphasizing human oversight and collaboration. It does not explicitly outline prohibited behaviors or rules regarding safety-related conduct. As a result, there are no concrete, structured rules detailing prohibited actions within educational environments mentioned in the content provided. The document instead provides guidelines for balancing AI capabilities with human judgment and emphasizes the role of training and education in understanding AI systems.
The document provided does not explicitly outline specific actions or behaviors that are prohibited within educational environments according to the AAMCâ€™s standards. Instead, it discusses principles and guidelines for implementing AI ethically in selection processes. Therefore, there are no explicit rules describing prohibited actions to extract from this document.
The provided AAMC policy document does not explicitly list prohibited actions or behaviors. Instead, it outlines responsibilities and best practices regarding transparency and communication around the use of AI in selection processes. If there were prohibitions mentioned, they might relate to misinforming applicants about AI use or failing to comply with data privacy standards. However, based on the content provided, there are no explicit rules detailing prohibited actions.
The document provided outlines principles and guidelines for the integration of AI-based selection systems, focusing on fairness and integrity, rather than specific prohibited behaviors in educational environments. However, based on these principles, I can infer some structured rules related to AI implementation that must be followed:

1. Do not use low-quality or unrepresentative data in AI system development, as it introduces biases and systematic distortions.
2. Do not allow AI to replace human judgment entirely in the selection process; ensure responsible oversight and balanced integration.
3. Do not implement AI tools without prior pilot testing in low- or no-stakes settings to identify and address any unintended consequences.
4. Do not modify the data collection, analysis, and evaluation process during an ongoing application cycle; maintain consistency throughout.
5. Do not neglect to audit AI systems regularly; failing to conduct an annual audit could overlook AI-related biases and problems.

These inferred rules align with the guidelines provided but are focused on the application of AI in selection processes rather than general educational conduct.

Hereâ€™s the refined and organized set of educational safety and integrity principles based on the provided rules:

---

### **Risk Category 1: Academic Integrity**  
1. Submitting AI-generated work as original student work without proper attribution is prohibited.  
2. Copying content from any source, including generative AI, without prior approval and adequate documentation is prohibited.  

### **Risk Category 2: Digital Conduct and Non-Harassment**  
3. Using AI tools to manipulate media for impersonation, bullying, harassment, or intimidation is strictly prohibited.  

### **Risk Category 3: Educator and Student Privacy**  
4. Using AI technologies to monitor classrooms (e.g., analyzing teacher-student interactions or tracking movements) without consent is prohibited.  
5. Entering confidential or personally identifiable information into unauthorized AI tools is prohibited.  
6. Using AI in ways that compromise teacher or student privacy or enable unauthorized data collection is prohibited.  

### **Risk Category 4: Ethical AI Use in Education**  
7. Using AI to supplant the role of human educators in instruction or student mentorship is prohibited.

### **Key Improvements:**  
- **Decomposition:** Rule 1 (original) was split into distinct concerns (impersonation vs. bullying/harassment), but since the original rule already combined these under "malicious intent," it was kept atomic.  
- **Merging:** Rules 6 and 7 (original) were merged into a unified privacy principle (Rule 6 refined).  
- **Clustering:** Categories reflect core educational risks (integrity, conduct, privacy, and ethical AI roles).  
- **Wording:** Rules are now concise, specific, and free from redundancy (e.g., "original work by students" clarified to "without proper attribution").

The Kubernetes API provides a RESTful interface that allows you to interact with the cluster and retrieve information about its components, including the nodes.\n\nTo use the Kubernetes API to discover the IP addresses of nodes in a cluster, you'll need to first obtain an API token. You can do this by running the following command:\n\n`kubectl get secrets`\n\nThis command will return a list of secrets in the cluster, including the API token.\n\nOnce you have the API token, you can use it to make requests to the Kubernetes API. For example, you can use the following command to retrieve a list of nodes in the cluster:\n\n`kubectl get nodes`\n\nThis command will return a list of nodes in the cluster, including their IP addresses.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `kubectl exec` command to run a command inside a pod and retrieve information about the node it's running on.
